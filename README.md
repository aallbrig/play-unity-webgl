## Play Unity WebGL (Wordpress Plugin)
Play Unity WebGL is a wordpress plugin that allows users to upload WebGL unity builds to their wordpress site.

### Isn't there already a plugin?
Surprisingly... [Not really](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/Unity/). Oddly enough, there is a unity asset store purchase for $30 that says it can do it but this doesn't seem like something worth $30.

### Why write this plugin?
This is meant to be a replacement of play.unity.com. That site is FANTASTIC but limiting. For example, if you upload your webGL unity project to play.unity.com then you can only play using a laptop or desktop computer. You cannot play your game on your phone. Bummer, especially since my friends would love to see games without too much friction!
